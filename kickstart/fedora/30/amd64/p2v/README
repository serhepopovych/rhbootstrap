This kickstart file is based on one created by
virt-p2v-maker-kickstart(1) command from virt-p2v-maker package on
Fedora 30 amd64 (i386) system. See it's manual page for more
information on requirements and how to build livecd image using provided
kickstart file(s).

Modifications added to original p2v.ks intended to bring support for
livenet (network/PXE) boot sharing squashfs image over NFS. That's
method much faster and doesn't have memory overhead compated to one
described in virt-p2v-maker-kickstart(1) that downloads image over TFTP.

Note that i386 and amd64 (x86_64) kickstart files differ in repo URLs and
binary format of virt-v2v(1) utility embedded to them.

Usually you want to generate RSA keypair with ssh-keygen(1) for ssh
public key authentication with conversion server and add base64(1)
encoded contents of unencrypted ~/.ssh/id_rsa private key to kickstart
file. This can be accomplished with below commands:

  (some host)$ ssh-keygen -f id_rsa.p2v -P ''

  (some host)$ ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.p2v virt-p2v@<conversion-server>

  (some host)$ base64 id_rsa.p2v | ssh <user>@<p2v-maker-host> \
               "sed -i p2v.ks -e '/^base64 .\+ \/var\/tmp\/id_rsa/r /dev/stdin'"

Most likely you also want to remove id_rsa.p2v after above steps to
keep copy(ies) at predictable location(s) (i.e. p2v-maker host, netboot
server).
