## common

# Listen on the given IP address(es). Both --interface and --listen-address
# options may be given, in which case the set of both interfaces and addresses
# is used. Note that if no --interface option is given, but --listen-address
# is, dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback interface. To
# achieve this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be explicitly given as a
# --listen-address option.
listen-address=127.0.0.1

# Listen only on the specified interface(s). Dnsmasq automatically adds the
# loopback (local) interface to the list of interfaces to use when the
# --interface option  is used.
#interface=lo255,en3.*

# A special case of --conf-file which differs in two respects. Firstly, only
# --server and --rev-server are allowed in the configuration file included.
# Secondly, the file is re-read and the configuration therein is updated when
# dnsmasq recieves SIGHUP.
servers-file=/run/dnsmasq.servers-file.conf

## dns

# Listen on <port> instead of the standard DNS port (53). Setting this to zero
# completely disables DNS function, leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
port=53

# Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only from the command line
# or the dnsmasq configuration file.
#no-resolv

# Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes.
#no-poll

# Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges
# (ie 192.168.x.x, etc) which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases
# file are answered with "no such domain" rather than being forwarded upstream.
bogus-priv

# Tells dnsmasq to never forward A or AAAA queries for plain names, without dots
# or domain parts, to  upstream  nameservers.
domain-needed

# Later versions of windows make periodic DNS requests which don't get sensible
# answers from the public DNS and can cause problems by triggering
# dial-on-demand links.
filterwin2k

# Add the domain to simple names (without a period) in /etc/hosts in the same
# way as for DHCP-derived names.
expand-hosts

# Default domain (needed by dhcp-fqdn)
domain=lan

# Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server.
domain=white.lan,192.168.5.0/24,local
domain=red.lan,192.168.6.0/24,local

# Log the results of DNS queries handled by dnsmasq. Enable a full cache dump
# on receipt of SIGUSR1.
#log-queries

## tftp

# Enable  the  TFTP  server  function.
#enable-tftp

# Look for files to transfer using TFTP relative to the given directory.
#tftp-root=/srv/tftp

# Set the maximum number of concurrent TFTP connections allowed.
#tftp-max=1000

## dhcp

# Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide
# DNS service.
no-dhcp-interface=*

# Should be set when dnsmasq is definitely the only DHCP server on a network.
# For DHCPv4, it changes the behaviour from strict RFC compliance so that DHCP
# requests on unknown leases from unknown hosts are not ignored. This allows
# new hosts to get a lease without a tedious timeout under all circumstances.
# It also allows dnsmasq to rebuild its lease database without each client
# needing to reacquire a lease, if the database is lost. For DHCPv6 it sets the
# priority in replies to 255 (the maximum) instead of 0 (the minimum).
dhcp-authoritative

# Limits dnsmasq to the specified maximum number of DHCP leases. The default
# is 1000. This limit is to prevent DoS attacks from hosts which create
# thousands of leases and use lots of memory in the dnsmasq process.
#dhcp-lease-max=1000

# DHCP IP unaddressed (unnumbered)
#bridge-interface=lo255,en3.*

# Address ranges (pools) configuration
dhcp-range=192.168.5.50,192.168.5.100,255.255.255.0,10m

# Read  /etc/ethers  for  information  about  hosts for the DHCP server.
# The format of /etc/ethers is a hardware address, followed by either a hostname
# or dotted-quad IP address. When read by dnsmasq these lines have exactly the
# same effect as --dhcp-host options containing the same information.
# /etc/ethers is re-read when dnsmasq receives SIGHUP.
# IPv6 addresses are NOT read from /etc/ethers.

# Match BIOS and EFI PXE clients
#dhcp-match=set:efi-x86_64,option:client-arch,7
#dhcp-match=set:efi-x86_64,option:client-arch,9

#dhcp-boot=tag:bios,/netboot.xyz.kpxe

# (IPv4  only) Generate a name for DHCP clients which do not otherwise
# have one, using the MAC address expressed in hex, separated by dashes.
# Note that if a host provides a name, it will be used by preference to
# this, unless --dhcp-ignore-names is set.
dhcp-generate-names

# In the default mode, dnsmasq inserts the unqualified names of DHCP clients
# into the DNS. For this reason, the names must be unique, even if two clients
# which have the same name are in different domains. If a second DHCP client
# appears which has the same name as an existing client, the name is
# transferred to the new client. If --dhcp-fqdn is set, this behaviour changes:
# the unqualified name is no longer put in the DNS, only the qualified name.
# Two DHCP clients with the same name may both keep the name, provided that the
# domain part is different (ie the fully qualified names differ.) To ensure that
# all names have a domain part, there must be at least --domain without an
# address specified when --dhcp-fqdn is set.
dhcp-fqdn

# Whenever a new DHCP lease is created, or an old one destroyed, or a TFTP file
# transfer completes, the executable specified by this option is run.
# <path> must be an absolute pathname, no PATH search occurs.

# Extra logging for DHCP: log all the options sent to DHCP clients and the tags
# used to determine them.
