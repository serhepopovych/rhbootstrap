# using /dev/urandom data and matched [0-9a-zA-Z]{$PASSLEN} extended
# regular expression pattern, optionally excluding ambiguous characters
# matcheded by [B8G6I1l0OQDS5Z2] regular expression.
#
# Note that excluding ambiguous characters from autogenerated passwords
# reduces their quality. It might be desirable to increase $PASSLEN in
# that case from default 8 to 12 or greather.
